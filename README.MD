# esx_truckerjob
This is a simple truckerjob which is easy to configure and supports multiple routes!

## How to install
- Put all the files in a sub directory (call it esx_truckerjob) within the resource directory of your server
- Install my [cr1tika7_utils](https://github.com/Cr1TiKa7/esx_cr1tika7_utils) resource first 
- Add 'start esx_truckerjob' to the server.cfg below all of the esx resources
- Adjust the config.lua as you want
- Start your server and enjoy!

## How it looks ingame
This is just an older sample video with a sample route which is already included in the config.lua. In the newer version there is a menu where you can choose one of the jobs.
